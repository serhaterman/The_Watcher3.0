"""Regression tests for the numeric-id route (2026-09-05).

Instagram's username-keyed profile API (web_profile_info) started answering
401 with a login wall for anonymous clients from every network measured —
residential ones included, even for @instagram — while the graphql reel query
BY NUMERIC ID kept answering through the Worker. Three sweeps in a row failed
every check, and a target renamed during the outage failed eight checks
without a word, because rename recovery waited for a 404 that a shut door
never sends.

What must hold:
- the throttle books the two doors separately: a shut username door closes
  THAT door for the sweep, while the gate is down only when nothing answers;
- a check asks by id first and a rename is persisted + announced even when
  the profile fetch after it is blocked;
- an id-only reading is live and PARTIAL: it carries the last full reading
  forward and alerts on nothing it did not see;
- a username 404 is surfaced, and worded by what the id route said;
- the sweep summary counts what was actually checked and answered.

Runs fully offline.
