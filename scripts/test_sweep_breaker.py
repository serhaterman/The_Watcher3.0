"""Regression tests for sweep pacing: the rate-limit guard and the retry rounds.

All of this changes PACING ON FAILURE only — never a request. A sweep checks
one account at a time by default (the same rhythm as a manual Recheck, which is
what Instagram's anonymous gate answers reliably); as consecutive 401/403 blocks
pile up the gap widens, a run of them pauses the sweep outright, and only if the
pauses don't help are the rest deferred — so a burst can't turn 4 blocks into 9.

Anything still blocked afterwards goes through paced retry rounds, because the
block lands on a REQUEST, not an account: that pass is what stops the summary
from naming "failures" the owner can re-check by hand and watch succeed.

Runs fully offline.
