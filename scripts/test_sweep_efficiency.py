"""What a sweep is allowed to spend (2026-09-07).

Every Instagram request a sweep makes is either useful or it is the reason
the next one gets refused. These are the places the sweep was spending
requests and seconds it did not need to:

- a page the phone had ALREADY delivered was used only after this host's own
  page request had been refused first — up to _DIRECT_PAGE_TIMEOUT seconds
  per account, and one more refused request from an IP already out of favour;
- a reel query went out for EVERY account every sweep, on the same home line
  the page door depends on, while the page answered the story question and
  nothing ever read the reel's answer;
- a PRIVATE account bought one of those every sweep forever: the story phase
  skips it, so its highlight-scan stamp never advanced and it read as
  permanently due — for a reel with no story, no live flag and no visible
  highlights in it;
- what the phone did deliver was then thrown away, so the live flag and the
  highlight catalog went missing for the whole page-served era;
- each check re-read the account's numeric id from the database, and a failed
  check re-read its privacy — both of which the sweep had already read to
  build its own list.

And one guard: with more than one lane, the pacing gap must space the
launches. Reading the next slot without claiming it let every waiting lane
wake to the same instant — a burst, which is the shape that trips the gate.

Runs fully offline.
