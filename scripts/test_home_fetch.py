"""Regression tests for the home fetcher's job broker and its two endpoints.

The owner's phone (or PC) polls the bot for profile pages to fetch and posts
the HTML back — no tunnel, no inbound port, because the home line is behind
carrier-grade NAT and an unrooted phone can run neither a port forward nor a
Tailscale Funnel.

What must hold:
- a check asks the broker and gets Instagram's answer back, matched by job id;
- with no worker polling, the broker answers "not connected" at once — a
  phone that is off must never stall a sweep;
- a worker that takes a job and never answers costs the check its timeout,
  nothing more, and a late answer is refused rather than mis-delivered;
- a job whose check already gave up is never handed to the worker;
- the endpoints refuse a missing/wrong token and say so when the door is
  disabled, and a gzip-compressed delivery is decoded.

Runs fully offline.
