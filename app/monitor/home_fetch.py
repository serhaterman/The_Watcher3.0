"""The home fetcher's job broker — the bot's side of the fourth door.

A device on a connection Instagram trusts (the owner's phone or PC — see
tools/home_fetcher) polls ``GET /home-fetch/jobs``, fetches what it is handed,
and POSTs Instagram's answers back to ``/home-fetch/jobs/<id>``. Nothing dials
INTO the home network: the owner's line sits behind carrier-grade NAT (a 10.x
WAN address) and an unrooted phone can neither forward a port nor run a
Tailscale Funnel — so the worker pulls work over ordinary outbound HTTPS, and
this broker hands it out and keeps the answers.

Two kinds of job:

- ``page`` — the profile page ``instagram.com/<username>/`` (counts, bio,
  privacy, story-up flag), keyed by username;
- ``reel`` — the graphql reel query by numeric id (current username, avatar,
  story/live status, highlight catalog), keyed by that id. The Worker's route
  for this is refused per colo and each refusal costs ~9 s; the phone's
  connection answers it in one.

Two things make it fast rather than merely working:

- **Checks never wait on the phone by design.** A sweep hands the broker its
  whole list up front (`prefetch`, `prefetch_reels`); the phone works through
  it — several jobs per poll, fetch after fetch — while the sweep runs, and
  each check picks its answers from the results already in hand (`cached`,
  `cached_reel`). A check only waits when its answer has not arrived yet.
- **Everything lives in memory and expires.** A result serves the sweep that
  asked for it (RESULT_TTL_SECONDS); a job nobody picked up within
  JOB_MAX_AGE_SECONDS is dropped; a worker that is not polling is simply
  "not connected" — a fast, quiet answer, so a phone that is off costs a
  sweep nothing.
