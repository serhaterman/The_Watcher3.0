"""Profile data from the logged-out profile page's embedded Relay payload.

When `web_profile_info` answers 401 there is a second door: the plain page at
instagram.com/<username>/. What it carries is NOT the Open Graph block — see
below — but the payload the page itself renders from, inlined in a script tag:

    "xig_user_by_username":{"pk":"7880052534","username":"65xim",
      "is_private":true,"biography":"…","full_name":"Mohamad",
      "is_verified":false,"follower_count":118,"following_count":577, …}

Same shape the API returns, same numbers the app shows, and it includes the
privacy flag — so a private account is never mistaken for a public one.

What it does NOT carry, on any capture measured so far: `all_media_count` is
null for public and private accounts alike, so the post count never comes from
here. Nor do reels_count, story_count or is_business exist in the payload. The
avatar it gives is the 150×150 variant — SMALLER than the API's
profile_pic_url_hd (~320px), and it cannot be upsized: the CDN signature covers
the size transform, so editing `stp=` earns a 403 "URL signature mismatch"
(measured 2026-08-12).

## Why not the og: tags (this parser's first version, withdrawn 2026-08-12)

Because they are a stale cache, and a page can carry both at once. Verified on
a real profile, one response contained:

    <meta property="og:description" content="118 Followers, 677 Following, …">
    "follower_count":118,"following_count":577          <- and the rendered UI
                                                           said 577, as did the
                                                           Instagram app

Followers and posts agreed; following was 100 stale. Nothing in the meta block
marks it as old, so there is no read-time test that separates a good value from
a bad one — the whole surface had to go. The lesson generalises: a source being
LIVE says nothing about it being CORRECT, and only the embedded payload was
ever checked against ground truth and passed.

Fetched DIRECTLY, never through the Worker: sent that way it carries curl_cffi's
real Chrome TLS fingerprint, while a Worker hop would carry Cloudflare's runtime
fingerprint under a Chrome User-Agent. It also sends no `x-ig-app-id`, so it
reads as a page view rather than a private-API call.

Blocked pages and login walls simply parse to None, leaving the caller's error
intact. Absent fields stay absent (never `None` written over a known value, and
never a `0` invented for a count Instagram omitted).
