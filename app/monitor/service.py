class _SweepThrottle:
    """Concurrency gate + adaptive pacing + a 401 guard for one sweep.

    This never touches a request — it only decides WHEN the next account may be
    checked, and whether to keep going at all.

    `concurrency` lanes run at a time (1 by default: one account at a time, the
    same shape as a manual Recheck). The gap between checks is stamped when a
    slot is RELEASED, so it is a real gap between requests rather than between
    launches — a burst of launches that all sit waiting on a semaphore was the
    old behavior and it hit Instagram as one wave.

    As consecutive 401/403 blocks accumulate the gap widens (soft backoff). Once
    `breaker_threshold` blocks happen in a row the response depends on whether
    ANY account has answered this sweep:

    - some have (a partial throttle): pause for `cooldown` seconds so the short
      window can clear, then carry on — those accounts stay in THIS sweep. Only
      after `max_pauses` cooldowns fail does the breaker open and defer the rest.
    - none have (`gate_down`): the breaker opens immediately. Nothing is getting
      through, so there is no pace that helps; every extra request is blocked
      traffic that keeps the gate shut. One worker call is 6 upstream attempts,
      so walking the remaining list costs hundreds of blocked requests to learn
      what the first few already said.

    The two routes a check uses are booked separately (2026-09-05). The
    username route can be shut — a 401 login wall — while the numeric-id
    route answers: then `breaker_threshold` refused username lookups in a row
    with none answering close THAT door for the sweep (`username_door_closed`;
    the rest go by id only), and a check counts as blocked only when neither
    route answered. `gate_down` means Instagram answered nothing at all.

        - `already_announced` wins over everything. This check has already sent
          a message about the story — the media itself ("📖 @user — new story"),
          or the text alert that stands in when the downloads fail. A "HAS
          STORY" line after it is a second copy of the same news, which is the
          noise that made the per-sweep line unbearable in the first place. The
          baseline still advances, so nothing is lost.
        - otherwise the default (STORY_STATUS_HEARTBEAT) answers for EVERY
          check, including "⭕ NO STORY". Silence is not an answer: with
          change-only announcements, "nothing is up right now" and "the bot
          never got to this account" looked exactly the same from the outside.
        - `always` (manual Recheck) answers even with the heartbeat off, since
          someone is waiting on it.
        - with the heartbeat off, the line goes out only when the status DIFFERS
          from the one last announced, and "unknown" is never announced (the
          sweep summary already names every account Instagram wouldn't answer
          for).

        An unobserved status never becomes the baseline either way, so a blocked
        sweep can't manufacture a transition on recovery. Every status is logged,
        so the digest and history see every check regardless of what was sent.
