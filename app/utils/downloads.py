"""Where downloads are written, and what may be downloaded at all.

Guards for the two places the bot saves what it fetched

- the folder is named after the account, and usernames reach it from more
  than validated commands: a rename read off Instagram's own payloads, a
  handle saveinsta echoes back. "..", which the command pattern accepts, named
  the folder ABOVE the media root (measured 2026-11-05). A name that is not
  plainly one path component is replaced by a stable hash of it;
- the URL comes from a third party's HTML (saveinsta's download links) or
  Instagram's JSON, and the client underneath is libcurl, which also speaks
  file:// and others and connects to 127.0.0.1 for "127.1", "2130706433" or
  "%31%32%37.0.0.1" (measured 2026-11-05). Only http(s) from a public address
  is fetched: checked on every redirect hop, and against the address libcurl
  actually connected to, so a hostile link can neither read a local file nor
  bring back anything from this host's own network.
