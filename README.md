## Why The Watcher?

- 🕵️ **Truly anonymous.** Works with zero Instagram credentials — no account, no session cookie, no device fingerprint tied to you. There is nothing for Instagram to ban.
- 🔒 **Private accounts too.** Follower/following/post counts, bio, name, username, profile picture, and privacy flips are tracked even for private accounts — anonymously. (Media delivery applies to public accounts; private content is never accessed.)
- 🎬 **It doesn't just notify — it delivers.** New stories, posts, reels, highlights, and profile pictures arrive in your chat as actual photos and videos, not links.
- 📦 **One tap grabs a whole account.** The **Download all** panel pulls the story, photos, reels, every highlight, and the profile picture of any public account — all of it, or just the parts you tick.
- 📲 **Telegram is the entire UI.** Add targets, pause them, pull stories, tune the schedule, export history — all through inline buttons. You never touch a terminal after deploy.
- ☁️ **Built for datacenter hosting.** Instagram 401-blocks cloud-host IPs wholesale, so The Watcher routes **every** Instagram API call through a free Cloudflare Worker at the edge, and when that gate does close it falls through to the public profile page and a login-free media downloader on separate infrastructure. Render, Fly, any VPS.
- ⚡ **Proven at scale.** A single instance sweeps 25+ accounts around the clock — jittered scheduling, one account at a time, and a guard that backs off (or stops) the moment Instagram starts refusing, instead of hammering a shut door.
- 📦 **One container, five minutes.** A single Docker image with a `render.yaml` blueprint — database, persistent disk, and webhook included. Runs on a free-tier box.

## ✨ Recently Shipped

| | |
|---|---|
| 🏠 **A fourth door: an old phone at home** | Instagram now hands the logged-out profile page — the one with the follower/following counts, bio and privacy flag — only to IPs it hasn't seen scraping. Render's and Cloudflare's are both bounced to the login page with a `429`; your home line, VPN or phone gets it every time (measured 2026-09-05). `tools/home_fetcher` is a small worker you run in Termux on an old Android phone (or on your PC): it **polls the bot** for pages to fetch and posts them back, so it needs no tunnel, no port, no root — it works behind carrier-grade NAT. The bot asks it only after its own attempt was refused and parses the same payload. Phone off? The sweep stays id-only for that run and says so. |
| 🪪 **Every check asks by Instagram ID first** | On 2026-09-05 Instagram's username profile API started answering a **401 login wall** to anonymous clients from every network measured — residential ones included, even for `@instagram` — while the graphql route **by numeric id** kept answering through the Worker. Every check now opens with the id: the current username (so a renamed target is *found*, not lost), the avatar, story/live status and the highlight catalog. When the username route is refused, the reading is kept as **id-only** — live, partial, and labelled as such on the card and in the sweep summary: followers, bio and counts carry forward from the last full reading and are never guessed. A rename is persisted and announced even when the profile fetch after it is blocked, and a username that Instagram says no longer exists is reported, worded by what the id route said (renamed? deactivated? a glitch?). |
| 🚪 **A second door that reads the right numbers** | When the API is blocked, the profile page is parsed for the payload it actually renders from — the same fields the API returns, including the privacy flag. The first version of this read the page's `og:` meta tags instead and was **withdrawn after one day**: on the very same response they said *677 Following* where the payload, the rendered page and the Instagram app all said **577**. Live is not the same as correct — the tags are a stale cache, and only the payload was ever checked against ground truth. |
| 🔬 **`/probe <user>`** | Tests every source against one account and reports which answer — the API, the ID route (by the stored numeric id), the public page (with HTTP status and byte count), and the media downloader. Turns "everything is 401ing" into a specific, actionable answer in a few seconds, and logs the same at INFO. |
| 🎬 **You always know where a story stands** | Every check reports each public account's story state — `@user — ⭕ NO STORY` included, the answer that used to be silence (indistinguishable from "the bot never got there"). It's still never sent on top of the media that already announced the same story, so one story is still one message. `STORY_STATUS_HEARTBEAT=false` goes back to change-only announcements. |
| 🚦 **A guard that tells a throttle from an outage** | If some accounts answer, blocks mean a throttle: widen the gap, pause, carry on. If **nothing** answers, the gate is shut — the sweep stops immediately rather than spending hundreds of blocked requests proving it, and the summary says so instead of naming every account as a separate failure. The two routes are booked separately: a username door that refuses every lookup is closed for the rest of the sweep (the remaining accounts are checked by id only), and the gate counts as shut only when the id route is silent too. |
| 🧵 **One thread per account** | In a Topics-enabled group, the bot gives every monitored account its own forum thread — that account's profile changes, story status, highlights, media, and went-dark alerts route to its thread, while sweeps and summaries stay in General. Enable with `TELEGRAM_FORUM_TOPICS=true` then **Status → 🧵 Sync topics**. Deleted-topic and non-forum cases fall back to General safely. |
| 🎯 **Stakeout mode** | `/stakeout @user 2h` (or the 🎯 button) watches a single target on a tight loop for a set window, then auto-reverts to the normal schedule. Every tick is a full check — profile, posts, reels, stories, highlights — all through the edge proxy and 90s cache, with an interval floor that keeps it clear of Instagram's rate limits (no 401s). Survives restarts. |
| 📊 **Activity rhythm** | `/rhythm @user` (or the 📊 button) charts *when* a target is active — an hour-of-day and day-of-week histogram built from everything the bot has caught, in your local time. Spot the windows they post in at a glance. |
| 🌑 **Went-dark radar** | The sweep flags any account that posts nothing — no story, post, or reel — for N days (`DARK_RADAR_DAYS`, default 3), and announces the comeback when they return. `/darkradar` lists every target ranked by how long they've been quiet. |
| 🛰 **Every Instagram call rides the edge** | Story/live status, highlight names, and `/add` by numeric ID now go through the same free Cloudflare Worker proxy as profile fetches — so they work flawlessly from cloud hosts whose IPs Instagram 401-blocks. Repeated lookups are served from a 90-second cache, and retry storms against blocked endpoints are gone. |
| 🪶 **Featherweight database** | Each snapshot now stores ~300 bytes instead of Instagram's full 50–200 KB payload — ~99% smaller. A free 0.5 GB Postgres now lasts effectively forever. |
| 🔄 **Full-coverage rechecks** | A manual recheck (🔄 button, `/recheck`, REST endpoint) now covers exactly what a scheduled sweep covers: profile diff, new posts & reels, story & live status, highlight catalog changes, and new story/highlight media delivery. |
| 📦 **Bulk download — a whole account in one tap** | New home-menu button. Pick a monitored account or type any username, profile URL, or numeric ID, then tick exactly what you want — 📖 story, 🖼 photos, 🎬 reels, 👤 profile picture, and each highlight by name — or hit **⚡ Download EVERYTHING**. Live per-category progress, a final summary, and zero login, like everything else. |
| 🔕 **Per-highlight tracking** | Choose exactly which highlights to follow, per account. Mute one, several, or all — muted highlights are skipped by the sweep's auto-download (and not even fetched), while manual downloads keep working. Unmuting resumes cleanly from now, without dumping everything posted in between. |
| 🖼 **Post & reel auto-delivery** | Every sweep detects new posts/reels and sends the actual media to your chat — capped at 5 per sweep so a posting spree never floods you. First sweep baselines silently (no backlog dump). |
| 🔓 **Went-public auto-grab** | The moment a monitored account flips from private to public, the sweep automatically delivers its backlog — posts, reels, highlights, and current story — instead of baselining it silently. Only media the chat hasn't already received is sent: the first flip delivers everything, and an account that keeps flipping private/public afterwards gets just what's new since the last grab, never the whole account again. A flip that turns up nothing new costs a single message, the profile change card, with no media and no follow-up. Retries on a later sweep if the source is briefly rate-limited. Toggle with `AUTO_GRAB_ON_PUBLIC` (default on). |
| ⏸ **Pause / resume targets** | Freeze monitoring with one tap or `/pause` — history, snapshots, and the resolved Instagram ID are all preserved. Resume picks up exactly where it left off. |
| 🔎 **Any public account, on demand** | `/story @user` and `/highlights @user` grab media from **any** public account — no need to monitor it. Also available as the **🔎 Any user** menu button. |
| ⬇️ **Download-all highlights** | One button fetches every highlight of an account, full quality. |
| 🔴 **Live & story status** | The account card shows `🔴 live now` / `🎬 has an active story` in real time — checked at the moment you open the card, not at the last sweep. |
| 🖼 **Max-quality profile pictures** | Full-resolution avatars instead of the 320 px anonymous ceiling, with automatic fallback for accounts the high-res path can't reach. |
| ⚡ **Faster everywhere** | Downloader tokens are cached, blocked endpoints fast-fail instead of timing out, and account cards render instantly. |

## How It Works

The Watcher runs as a single container. It connects to your Telegram bot, sweeps a list of Instagram targets on a schedule, diffs each profile against its last snapshot, and pushes changes — with media — to your chat.

```

**Three independent doors, with different jobs.**

1. **The numeric-id route** (the graphql reel query), through a free Cloudflare Worker on edge IPs — asked **first** on every check. It answers with the current username, the avatar, story/live status and the highlight catalog, and as of 2026-09-05 it is the route Instagram still answers anonymously. It knows nothing about counts, bio or privacy, and the bot never pretends it does.
2. **The profile API by username** (`web_profile_info`), through the same Worker — the full profile fields, and the source of record whenever it answers. Since 2026-09-05 it returns a 401 login wall to anonymous clients from every network measured, so until it reopens most readings are *id-only*.
3. **The public profile page**, used only when the API answers 401/403 — fetched by this host first and, when `HOME_FETCH_TOKEN` is set, by a device of yours running [`tools/home_fetcher`](tools/home_fetcher/README.md) — an old phone in Termux or your PC, which polls the bot for work — since Instagram serves the page to your connection but bounces datacenter IPs to the login page. Parsed from the **Relay payload the page renders from** — not its `og:` meta tags, which are a stale cache that reported *677 Following* on a response whose payload, rendered HTML and app all said **577**. A page reading is marked *partial*: it carries the counts, name, bio and flags, and honestly does not know the reel/highlight counts.
4. **A login-free media downloader** for story/post/reel media and full-resolution avatars, on infrastructure that cloud-IP blocks don't touch. This is why media keeps arriving during an API outage.

> When every door is shut the bot reports the failure. It never presents old or uncertain data as current — and the rule the withdrawn `og:` parser bought the hard way is that **being live is not the same as being correct**. See [the write-up](docs/2026-08-11-gate-blocks-and-the-second-door.md).

`/probe <username>` tests every source and tells you which are answering right now.

## 🚀 Features

### Change Detection
- Tracks 10+ profile fields: followers, following, posts, reels, highlights, biography, full name, username, external link, verification badge, business flag, public/private status
- **Works on private accounts** — all profile-level fields above are tracked for private targets, including an alert the moment an account goes private or public
- Profile-picture change detection — avatars are compared by a perceptual fingerprint that ignores Instagram's per-URL re-encodes (so it never cries wolf) yet catches real swaps, and archived to disk
- Story & live status checked every sweep and announced when it changes — one message per story, not one per sweep — plus a live check whenever you open an account card
- Highlight catalog tracking — detects added, renamed, and removed highlights by name
- Sweep-complete summary after every run, so you always know the bot is alive

### Media Delivery
- **New posts & reels** auto-downloaded and sent as photos/videos the sweep they appear
- **Stories** fetched and delivered with per-item deduplication — each story is sent exactly once
- **Highlights** listed by name with per-highlight download buttons and a download-all option
- **Per-highlight mute** — 🔕 toggle any highlight (or mute/track all at once) to control exactly what the sweep auto-downloads; muted ones are marked on the account card and skipped without being fetched
- **Profile pictures** in maximum available resolution, on demand via `/fetchphoto`
- **📦 Bulk download** — one panel grabs a whole account: story, photos, reels, profile picture, and any (or all) highlights, with checkbox selection or a one-tap **⚡ EVERYTHING** button
- All media retrieval is **login-free** — no Instagram session is ever used

### On-Demand Lookups
- `/story @user` and `/highlights @user` work on **any public account**, monitored or not
- **🔎 Any user** menu button does the same with zero typing
- **📦 Download all** menu button bulk-grabs any account — monitored or not — by username, profile URL, or numeric Instagram ID

### Intelligence
- **🎯 Stakeout mode** — temporarily watch one target on a tight loop (`/stakeout @user 2h` or the 🎯 button), then auto-revert. Rate-limit-safe: a hard interval floor above the 90s cache, all traffic via the edge proxy. Survives restarts and shows in `/status`
- **📊 Activity rhythm** — `/rhythm @user` renders an hour-of-day and day-of-week histogram of when a target is active, in local time
- **🌑 Went-dark radar** — sweeps flag accounts silent for `DARK_RADAR_DAYS` days and announce their return; `/darkradar` ranks every target by how long it's been quiet

### Target Management
- Add targets by `@username`, full profile URL, or raw numeric Instagram ID
- Pause/resume per target — paused accounts keep their entire history and resolved Instagram ID
- Paginated account list with live 🟢 / ⏸ state markers
- Per-target forced recheck, change history, and stored-photo retrieval

### Reliability
- **Every Instagram API call routed through a Cloudflare Worker edge proxy** (free tier, 100k req/day) — cloud-host IP blocks never reach the bot; falls back to direct requests if the proxy is down
- Chrome TLS fingerprint impersonation (`curl_cffi`) to clear 401/403 walls on the direct path
- 90-second reel-data cache — sweeps and card opens never re-ask Instagram for the same data
- Fast-fail circuit breaker on blocked endpoints instead of retry storms
- **Four independent doors to Instagram** — the numeric-id route through the edge proxy (asked first: username, avatar, story status, highlights), the profile API by username through the same proxy, the public profile page's embedded payload as a partial fallback when the API 401s, and a login-free media downloader for stories/posts/reels. When the API gate shuts, media keeps flowing and profile counts often still arrive; when every door is shut the bot reports an honest failure rather than a number it can't stand behind
- Sweeps check one account at a time — the same request rhythm as a manual recheck, since bursts are what trip Instagram's anonymous rate limiter
- Rate-limit guard that tells a throttle from an outage: if some accounts are answering, it widens the gap and pauses until the window clears; if **nothing** is answering it stops the sweep outright, because no pace helps a shut gate and every extra request keeps it shut. The username door and the id route are counted separately, so a username door that refuses every lookup is closed for the rest of the sweep instead of stopping it
- Blocked-request amplification is budgeted per path — one proxied call is already 6 upstream attempts, so a sweep asks once (14 accounts multiply everything), while an on-demand check retries across Cloudflare colos, which the gate answers differently
- Anything still blocked is retried in paced rounds before it's ever called a failure — and the summary names a shut gate as one problem instead of listing every account as if each had failed separately
- Cached downloader tokens — the three-step token handshake runs once, not per request
- Tenacity retries with exponential backoff; debounced failure alerts (no 429 spam)
- Consecutive-failure counter per target, visible in `/status` and `/list`

### Data & API
- PostgreSQL persistence: snapshots, media hashes, notification log, seen-item dedup, runtime settings
- **Featherweight snapshots** — ~300 bytes stored per check instead of Instagram's 50–200 KB raw payload, so a free 0.5 GB database lasts for years
- Configurable retention windows + a **Clear Old Data** button right in the bot
- HTTP API with liveness/readiness probes and a cron-compatible `/sweep` endpoint
- Token-gated mutation endpoints; CSV export of the full notification history

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, a PostgreSQL instance (local or remote)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/m0hx65/The_Watcher3.0.git
cd The_Watcher3.0

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID, DATABASE_URL

# 3. Install
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The bot starts in long-polling mode (no public URL required). Send `/add <username>` to your bot and you're monitoring.

---

## 🐳 Docker

```bash
docker build -t the-watcher .

docker run -d \
  --name watcher \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v watcher-media:/app/data/media \
  --env-file .env \
  the-watcher
```

The container exposes `/health` and ships a built-in `HEALTHCHECK`.

## ☁️ Deploy to Render

The `render.yaml` blueprint provisions everything automatically.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a free **[Neon](https://neon.tech)** Postgres (free tier, no card, and
   — unlike Render's free database — it doesn't expire). Copy its connection
   string; it can be pasted in verbatim (the `postgres://` prefix and
   `sslmode`/`channel_binding` params are normalized for asyncpg automatically).
3. In Render: **New +** → **Blueprint** → select your fork. Render provisions:
   - A Docker web service
   - A 1 GB persistent disk at `/app/data` for stored profile pictures
4. Set the secrets in the Render dashboard:

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) |
   | `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Your chat or channel ID |
   | `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS` | Comma-separated Telegram user IDs (optional) |
   | `DATABASE_URL` | Your Neon connection string |

   `WEB_API_TOKEN` is auto-generated by Render.

5. Click **Deploy**. The service registers a Telegram webhook on its public URL and starts sweeping immediately — Instagram's cloud-IP blocks are bypassed out of the box: `render.yaml` presets `IG_PROXY_URL` to a Cloudflare Worker edge proxy that carries every Instagram API call.

> **Already running on Render's free Postgres?** It expires ~30 days after
> creation. Move your data to Neon with zero loss using
> [`scripts/migrate_db.py`](scripts/migrate_db.py) — see the runbook at
> [docs/2026-06-11-neon-db-migration.md](docs/2026-06-11-neon-db-migration.md).

### Optional: External Cron Trigger

Render's free tier may suspend the service between requests. Use a Render Cron Job or any external scheduler to keep sweeps firing:

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST https://<your-service>.onrender.com/sweep \
  -H "X-API-Token: $WEB_API_TOKEN"
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings come from environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development.

### Required

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | ID of the chat or channel that receives alerts |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string — `postgres://`, `postgresql://`, and `postgresql+asyncpg://` are all accepted |

### Telegram

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated user IDs allowed to use the bot. Empty = allow all |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` | _(empty)_ | Public base URL for webhook registration. Auto-inferred from `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` on Render |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | _(empty)_ | Optional secret validated against Telegram's `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PATH` | `/telegram/webhook` | Webhook path registered with Telegram and mounted by FastAPI |

### Scheduler

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CHECK_INTERVAL` | `1800` | Seconds between full sweeps |
| `JITTER_SECONDS` | `120` | Maximum random seconds added to each interval |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_FETCHES` | `3` | Max parallel profile fetches per sweep |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | `20` | Per-request timeout in seconds |
| `SWEEP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `1500` | Hard cap on one sweep, after which it's abandoned so a hung connection can't block every later run. Must clear the paced sweep *plus* whatever the guard may legitimately spend waiting (pauses + retry budget), or it starts killing healthy sweeps mid-flight. Keep it well under `CHECK_INTERVAL` |

### Sweep Pacing & Rate-Limit Guard

Pacing-on-failure only — none of this ever changes a request, just when (and whether) the next one happens.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SWEEP_CONCURRENCY` | `1` | Accounts checked at once. `1` is the same request rhythm as a manual recheck, which is the pattern Instagram's anonymous gate answers reliably. Raise only if a sweep can't finish in time — every extra lane is a bigger burst |
| `SWEEP_STAGGER_MAX_SECONDS` | `12` | Ceiling on the gap between checks. The gap starts at 2s and widens by one step per consecutive block, relaxing back on success |
| `SWEEP_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` | `5` | Consecutive 401/403 blocks before the guard reacts. `0` disables the guard (adaptive pacing still runs) |
| `SWEEP_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `90` | How long the sweep pauses when blocks pile up *but some accounts are answering* — a throttle worth waiting out. `0` = defer immediately instead of pausing. When **nothing** is answering the sweep stops outright instead, since no pace helps a shut gate |
| `SWEEP_RETRY_ROUNDS` | `3` | Paced re-check rounds for blocked accounts after the sweep, each after a longer cooldown (30s, 60s, 120s). A block lands on a *request*, not an account, so a paced retry often goes through — this is what stops the summary reporting failures you can't reproduce by hand. `0` disables |
| `SWEEP_RETRY_BUDGET_SECONDS` | `300` | Shared wall-clock budget for those rounds, so a real outage can't stretch a sweep indefinitely |

### Stakeout & Radar

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `STAKEOUT_DEFAULT_INTERVAL` | `180` | Seconds between checks during a stakeout |
| `STAKEOUT_MIN_INTERVAL` | `120` | Floor for the stakeout interval — kept above the 90s reel cache so every tick is fresh without risking 401s |
| `STAKEOUT_DEFAULT_DURATION` | `3600` | Default stakeout length in seconds when none is given |
| `STAKEOUT_MAX_DURATION` | `21600` | Hard cap (6 h) on a single stakeout |
| `DARK_RADAR_DAYS` | `3` | Flag a target after this many days with no story/post/reel. `0` disables the radar |
| `TELEGRAM_FORUM_TOPICS` | `false` | Give each account its own forum topic when the chat is a Topics-enabled group and the bot is admin with *Manage topics*. Global messages stay in General |
| `TELEGRAM_MIRROR_CHAT_IDS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated extra chats that receive a flat copy of every notification — e.g. your DM, while `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is the forum group. Mirrors never use topics |

### Storage & Retention

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MEDIA_DIR` | `./data/media` | Directory for downloaded profile pictures |
| `SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | Days to keep account snapshots. `0` = keep forever |
| `NOTIFICATION_RETENTION_DAYS` | `90` | Days to keep notification logs |
| `RAW_RESPONSE_RETENTION_DAYS` | `7` | Days to keep raw Instagram API responses |
| `MEDIA_RETENTION_DAYS` | `14` | Days to keep downloaded story/post files. They were already delivered to Telegram and an on-demand request re-downloads, so this is a cache, not an archive. `0` = keep forever |

### Notifications & Digest

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `STORY_STATUS_HEARTBEAT` | `true` | Post a `HAS STORY` / `NO STORY` / `LIVE NOW` line on every check, so you always know where each public account stands — silence is never the answer. It is never sent on top of the media (or its text stand-in) that already announced the same story, so a check stays one message; private accounts never produce a line. `false` announces the status only when it **changes**. A manual recheck always answers, and every status is logged for the digest either way |
| `HIGHLIGHT_SCAN_INTERVAL` | `21600` | Seconds between full re-lists of every highlight reel's media. A reel only changes when its owner adds a story to it — and that story was already caught and delivered live minutes earlier. Reels new to the catalog are always listed immediately. `0` = re-list everything every sweep (~12× the traffic) |
| `AUTO_GRAB_ON_PUBLIC` | `true` | When a monitored account flips private → public, deliver its backlog (only what the chat hasn't already received) instead of silently baselining it |
| `FOLLOWER_ANOMALY_ABS_MIN` | `500` | A follower change is flagged only when it's large in **both** absolute and relative terms, so it never fires on a small account's noise or a big account's drift. Either value at `0` disables the alert |
| `FOLLOWER_ANOMALY_PCT_MIN` | `0.10` | The relative half of that test (10% of the prior count) |
| `DIGEST_HOUR` | `9` | Hour (UTC) at which a scheduled digest fires. The mode — off/daily/weekly — is set at runtime with `/digest` |
| `DIGEST_WEEKDAY` | `0` | Weekday for a weekly digest (0 = Monday) |

### Instagram

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `IG_SESSION_COOKIE` | _(empty)_ | **Optional** — full cookie string from a logged-in browser session. The bot is fully functional without it; login-free is the default and recommended mode |
| `IG_PROXY_URL` | _(empty)_ | Cloudflare Worker that proxies **all** Instagram API calls — profile fields, story/live status, highlight catalog, ID-to-username resolution. Strongly recommended on cloud hosts (preset in `render.yaml`); without it the bot makes direct requests, which datacenter IPs usually get 401-blocked on |
| `HOME_FETCH_TOKEN` | — | Shared secret for [`tools/home_fetcher`](tools/home_fetcher/README.md), the worker on your phone or PC that polls `/home-fetch/jobs` for profile pages to fetch. Same value in the worker's `home_fetcher.env`. Empty = the door is off |
| `HOME_FETCH_LOW_BATTERY_PERCENT` | `20` | The worker reports its battery with every poll; at or below this while not charging you get one Telegram alert, one more at half of it, and a "charging again" when it's back on power. `0` disables |
| `USERNAME_API_RECHECK_SECONDS` | `43200` | How long a sweep's verdict that the username API is login-walled is remembered. While it holds, the next sweep knocks on that API once instead of `SWEEP_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` times, and manual checks skip it — the ID route and the page doors still run. Reopens the moment a knock answers |
| `IG_SWEEP_AUTH_ATTEMPTS` | `1` | How many times a sweep re-asks the Worker after a 401. One Worker call is already 6 upstream attempts, and a sweep multiplies every extra attempt by every account — that traffic is what keeps the gate shut, so the second chance is left to the retry rounds |
| `IG_MANUAL_AUTH_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | Same, for on-demand checks (Recheck, card open, `/story`). A repeat call may leave from a different Cloudflare colo, and the gate answers differently per colo — so it's a real second chance. One account with someone waiting is not what shuts the gate |

The story/live status is reported from live reel data only — never re-read from a stored snapshot. When Instagram doesn't answer, the bot says the status is unavailable rather than repeating a stale one.

### Proxy & Network

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PROXY_URL` | _(empty)_ | Outbound proxy for all requests (`http://...` or `socks5://...`). Overrides `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` |
| `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` | _(empty)_ | Standard proxy env vars (used when `PROXY_URL` is unset) |

### Web API & Runtime

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WEB_API_TOKEN` | _(empty)_ | If set, required as `X-API-Token` header for `/sweep` and `/accounts/*/recheck` |
| `PORT` | `8000` | Web server port |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` |

---

## 💬 Telegram Commands & Menus

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/start` or `/menu` | Open the main inline menu |
| `/add <target>` | Start monitoring — accepts `@username`, `https://instagram.com/username`, or a numeric Instagram ID. Runs an immediate baseline fetch |
| `/remove <user>` | Stop monitoring and delete all stored history (`/rm` is an alias) |
| `/pause <user>` | Pause monitoring — the target and its full history stay in the database |
| `/resume <user>` | Resume a paused target exactly where it left off |
| `/list` | All monitored accounts with 🟢 / ⏸ state, last-check status, and failure count |
| `/recheck <user>` | Force an immediate check outside the schedule |
| `/stakeout <user> [duration]` | Watch one target on a tight loop for a window (e.g. `2h`), then auto-revert. Rate-limit-safe |
| `/unstakeout <user>` | End a stakeout early |
| `/rhythm <user>` | Posting-time histogram — when the target is active, by hour and weekday |
| `/darkradar` | List monitored accounts ranked by how long they've been silent |
| `/synctopics` | Create a forum topic per account (needs `TELEGRAM_FORUM_TOPICS=true` + a Topics group) |
| `/interval [value]` | Show or set the sweep interval — `30m`, `1h`, `1800s`, `1h30m`. No argument shows presets |
| `/status` | Global stats: accounts (+ paused / needs-attention), last & next sweep, digest mode, gone-dark count, active guards, and last-hour fetch health |
| `/history <user>` | Recent detected changes for a target |
| `/digest [off\|daily\|weekly]` | Show/preview or set the daily or weekly roll-up of all changes (no argument previews the recent window) |
| `/photo <user>` | Latest stored profile picture and its SHA-256 hash |
| `/fetchphoto <user>` | Download the current profile picture in max quality — works for any public account |
| `/story <user>` | Download any public user's **current story** — no monitoring required |
| `/highlights <user>` | List any public user's highlights with per-item download buttons |
| `/probe <user>` | Test every profile source against one account and report which answer — the API, the ID route, the public page from this host and from the home fetcher (with status and byte count), and the media downloader. The fast way to tell a blocked gate from a broken route |
| `/kill` | Stop an in-progress on-demand download (story / highlights / posts / bulk). Already-sent media stays; the rest is skipped (`/stop` is an alias) |
| `/export` | Full notification history as CSV |
| `/help` | Command reference |

**Everything is also reachable through buttons** — no commands required:

- **Main menu** — Accounts · Status · Add · Interval · Export · Help · **🔎 Any user** · **📦 Download all** · **Sweep All**
- **Account card** — Recheck · History · Photo · Remove · **Story** · **Highlights** · **📊 Rhythm** · **🎯 Stakeout** · **Pause ⇄ Resume**
- **Highlights view** — ⬇️ Download all (n), one download button per highlight, plus 🔕/🔔 mute toggles per highlight and a mute-all / track-all shortcut
- **📦 Bulk download panel** — asks whether the target is monitored (pick from the list) or not (type a username, URL, or ID), then shows checkboxes for 📖 Story · 👤 Profile pic · 🖼 Photos · 🎬 Reels · every highlight by name, with a select-all-highlights shortcut. **⬇️ Download selected** sends exactly what's ticked; **⚡ Download EVERYTHING** sends it all — with live per-category progress and a final summary
- **Status view** — Sweep Now · **🌑 Dark radar** · Interval · **Clear Old Data** (with confirmation)
- **Interval picker** — presets from 5 m to 6 h plus free-form custom entry
- **Panel bumping** — after every notification the panel re-posts at the bottom of the chat, so it's always within thumb's reach. It re-posts *whatever view is currently open* — Status, "Sweep running", Dark radar — rather than snapping back to the menu, and it waits out a running download so it lands under the finished batch instead of between its media items

> **🧵 One thread per target:** run the bot in a Telegram group with **Topics**
> enabled, set `TELEGRAM_FORUM_TOPICS=true`, and tap **Status → 🧵 Sync topics**
> (or `/synctopics`). Each account gets its own thread; global messages stay in
> General. Full guide: [docs/telegram-forum-topics.md](docs/telegram-forum-topics.md).

## 🔌 HTTP API

All responses are JSON. Mutation endpoints require `X-API-Token` when `WEB_API_TOKEN` is configured.

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET`/`HEAD` | `/health` | None | Liveness probe — returns `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `GET` | `/ready` | None | Readiness probe — checks monitor and scheduler state |
| `GET` | `/status` | None | Stats: account counts, last sweep time, scheduler info |
| `GET` | `/accounts` | None | List all monitored accounts |
| `POST` | `/accounts/{username}/recheck` | Token | Force an immediate check for one account |
| `POST` | `/sweep` | Token | Trigger a full sweep across all active accounts |

```bash
curl -X POST https://<host>/sweep -H "X-API-Token: your-token"
```

## 🗄 Data Model

Tables are created automatically on first boot via SQLAlchemy `create_all`.

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `monitored_accounts` | One row per target: username, resolved Instagram ID, active/paused flag, last status, failure count |
| `account_snapshots` | One row per *changed* fetch: parsed profile fields, HTTP status, and a slim ~300-byte record (numeric id + what the reel query said) instead of Instagram's 50–200 KB payload. Identical repeat fetches are not stored |
| `profile_media_hashes` | One row per unique profile picture (SHA-256 + disk path), deduplicated across accounts |
| `notification_logs` | One row per dispatched change event: type, payload, delivery status |
| `seen_stories` | Delivery dedup for stories, highlight items, **and posts/reels** — each media item is sent exactly once |
| `stored_highlights` | Per-account highlight catalog (id + title) used to detect added/renamed/removed highlights, with the per-highlight `tracked` mute flag |
| `app_settings` | Key-value store for runtime-tunable config persisted across restarts |

Pausing a target never deletes anything — the row, its Instagram ID, and all history survive until you explicitly `/remove`.

## 🧪 Tests

Every suite is a standalone script that exits non-zero on failure — no pytest dependency. The runner executes each in its own subprocess, so a crash or a leaked event loop in one can't poison another.

```bash
python scripts/run_tests.py           # all offline suites
python scripts/run_tests.py -k story  # only suites whose name matches
python scripts/run_tests.py --all     # include live-network probes
```

Offline suites need no network and no Postgres (they run on SQLite), so they work in CI and in a sandbox. Live-network probes — which hit the real Instagram and downloader endpoints — are skipped unless you pass `--all`, because a red suite that only means "no internet here" teaches everyone to ignore red.

## ⚖️ Responsible Use

- The Watcher reads only what Instagram serves **anonymously** through undocumented, rate-limited endpoints. For private accounts that means profile metadata only — private stories, posts, and media are never accessed.
- Only monitor accounts you have a legitimate reason to track: your own accounts, brand assets, or authorized OSINT research.
- Increase `CHECK_INTERVAL` and reduce `MAX_CONCURRENT_FETCHES` for large target lists.
- 401/403/429 responses are surfaced to you (debounced), so you know immediately if you're being throttled.
